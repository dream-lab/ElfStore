# ElfStore: Edge-local federated Store

Sumit K Monga, Sheshadri K R, Yogesh Simmhan.

ElfStore, a first-of-its-kind edge-local federated store for streams of data blocks. It uses reliable fog devices as a super-peer
overlay to monitor the edge resources, over federated metadata indexing using Bloom filters, locates data within 2-hops, and maintains approxi
mate global statistics about the reliability and storage capacity of edges. Edges host the actual data blocks, and we use a unique diferential replication scheme to select edges on which to replicate blocks, to guarantee a minimum reliability and to balance storage utilization.
